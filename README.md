## About bash_friend

**bash_friend** is a **Bash Friend Assistant for your tmux terminal** -
an AI-powered command-line helper that uses Claude AI to assist you with
terminal tasks.

### What I Am

I’m an intelligent terminal assistant that: - **Captures your tmux
terminal history** using `tmux capture-pane -p` - **Understands
context** from what you’ve been doing in your terminal - **Uses Claude
Sonnet 4.5** (the latest model) as my AI brain - **Has access to two
powerful tools**: 1. **`view`** - To view directory contents and file
contents (with optional line ranges) 2. **`rg`** (ripgrep) - To search
through files quickly and efficiently

### How I Work

When you run `bfriend "your question"`, I: 1. Capture your current tmux
terminal history 2. Combine it with your question 3. Use Claude AI to
analyze the context and your query 4. Can make up to 5 steps of tool
calls (viewing files, searching code, etc.) 5. Provide you with an
informed answer based on what I find

### My Architecture

- Built with **nbdev** (literate programming framework)
- Uses **lisette** library for AI chat functionality
- Uses **fastcore** for utilities
- Written in Python
- Installed as a command-line tool via `bfriend` command

### My Purpose

I’m designed to be your intelligent bash companion - helping you
understand codebases, debug issues, find files, and answer questions ab
out your terminal environment, all while being aware of what you’ve been
doing in your session!
